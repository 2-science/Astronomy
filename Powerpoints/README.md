**Astronomy Resources and Code** BETA

:ringed_planet:

This repo is for my Astronomy PPTS, CODE, and Practicals (including observing).

I suggest you start by looking at the documents in the **Supplements** Directory.

Those documents provide an overview of how to use these resources.

:milky_way:

It was designed to be useful for any course however I use it to teach the BTEC National Extended Diploma in Applied Science Unit 16: Astronomy and Space.
