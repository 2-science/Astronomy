# Code

This directory contains code on various Astronomy topics.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DimitriosAstro/Astronomy/master)  
**Binder repository of my notebooks**  
Binder will launch an interactive session with this repository allowing the user to interact with all notebooks.

Each folder contains the following:

* **.ipynb** - An interactive python file
* **.py** - A normal python file
* Any **inputs** required to run the code
* Any **products** from the code (ouput images etc.)

**Alternate ways of running notebooks**

The .ipynb files can be run my going to https://jupyter.org/try.  
Click on **Try JupyterLab** and wait for it to load.  
Upload the **.ipynb** file using the Upload File button (little upwards arrow in the top right).

Or you could install JupyterLab on your local machine.

The **.ipynb** files contain tasks for students. The **.py** files contain the solutions.

**nbgrader**

nbgrader is a tool to make assignments out of notebooks and mark them.

The **source** and **resources** files contain nbgrader versions of **AstPy-1**.
The gradebook file is also generated by nbgrader.

At the moment I have limited use for nbgrader assignments so there most likely won't be nbgrader versions of all notebooks.

AstPy Number | Description     | Data Files  | Comments
------------ | -------------   | ----------- | --------
1 | Intro to Python and Numpy ||
2 | Challenge: Bouncing Balls || Bit harder than intro - adds plotting + animation
3 | Stellar Fusion | Nuclear masses and binding energies (csv) |  Binding energy anim
4 | Solar Images | Various SDO HMI and AIA FITS | Getting SDO/SOHO Images
5 | Solar Radiation | | Blackbody rad, Wien's law etc.
