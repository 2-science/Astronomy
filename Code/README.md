# Code

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DimitriosAstro/Astronomy/master?filepath=Code)  

## Intro

This directory contains code on various Astronomy topics.

Each code has a teacher version with all outputs. These have the suffix Teacher. The student file is much smaller as it is missing the outputs and has code completition tasks for the students to complete.

At the start of the code is the **Aim** of the activity along with a **Predict** section which encourages the students to think about the topic before starting the activity.

The goal of the coding activities is mainly to **process** and **visualise** data and **extract physical insights** from them (as described in the AAPT report below). Although by performing the activities students will inevitably also learn debugging, how to convert theory/models into code, and how to present data formally in a document or presentation.

The outputs (figures etc) were designed to be a starting point for my students to put their own data and visualisations in their reports and presentations. My hope is this will promote a deeper understanding of the topic and better engage the students/encourage ownership and pride in their work.  

Some are best done in pairs like the introduction activities AstPy1 and AstPy2. Activities are designed to take at most an hour with some taking an hour and a half (AstPy4 and AstPy6 for instance).

Folders starting with a ***C*** are the Astronomy and Python challenges that anyone can participate in. I will try and make them at least bi-monthly. Maybe less over the summer and new year. My solutions will be added to the folder after the end of the challenge.

**NOTE** - Sometimes when I update a interactive notebook with corrections I forget about the normal .py version so it's not the most up to date.  
When I make new commits the binder image is re-built so if it takes ages to load I'm sorry I forgot to rebuild the binder. (This takes a good 5-10 mins)

## How to run the code

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DimitriosAstro/Astronomy/master?filepath=Code)  
**Binder repository of my notebooks**  
Binder will launch an interactive session with this repository allowing the user to interact with all notebooks.

**Alternate ways of running notebooks**

The .ipynb files can be run my going to https://jupyter.org/try.  
Click on **Try JupyterLab** and wait for it to load.  
Upload the **.ipynb** file using the Upload File button (little upwards arrow in the top right).

Or you could install JupyterLab on your local machine.

The **.ipynb** files contain tasks for students. The Teacher **.ipynb** file contains the solutions.

**NOTE** - Sometimes there is a **.py** file with solutions and code to create more complex figures. I have NOT checked that these will run on JupyterLab. They were used to test my code before creating the interactive JupyterLab Notebooks.

## Inside each folder

Each folder contains the following:

* **.ipynb** - An interactive python file
* **Teacher.ipynb** - An interactive python file for teachers will solutions
* **.py** - A normal python file used for testing, or to perform other tasks not possible in a notebook
* Any **inputs** required to run the code
* Any **products** from the code (ouput images etc.)

## Assignment grading

**nbgrader**

[nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a tool to make assignments out of notebooks and mark them.

The **source** and **resources** files contain nbgrader versions of **AstPy-1**.
The gradebook file is also generated by nbgrader.

At the moment I have limited use for nbgrader assignments so there most likely won't be nbgrader versions of all notebooks.

## Data

There is now a ***Data*** directory where all data is stored. I will continue to keep all data files needed in their respective assignment directories as well.

# Table of code contents

# Challenges

A folder with a C then a number (C1 for instance) is one of the astronomy and python challenges!
Well my solution to it anyway.

Challenge Number | Date | Description     | Data Files  | Comments

2 | 2020 Summer | Create a program to track sunspots across the face of the Sun automatically. || Solution in AstPy-6
3 | 2020 Autumn | How much older would you be if you stayed on Earth instead of travelling to Alpha Centauri at a) warp 5? or b) sublight speed? | | Solution on Youtube! [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGmS2CCaKxg)
