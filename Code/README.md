# Code

This directory contains code on various Astronomy topics.

**Binder** repository of my notebooks  
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DimitriosAstro/Astronomy/master)
Binder will launch an interactive session with this repository allowing the user to interact with all notebooks.

Each folder contains the following:

* **.ipynb** - An interactive python file
* **.py** - A normal python file
* Any **inputs** required to run the code
* Any **products** from the code (ouput images etc.)

The .ipynb files can be run my going to https://jupyter.org/try.  
Click on **Try JupyterLab** and wait for it to load.  
Upload the **.ipynb** file using the Upload File button (little upwards arrow in the top right).

Alternatively you could install JupyterLab on your local machine.

The **.ipynb** files contain tasks for students. The **.py** files contain the solutions.
