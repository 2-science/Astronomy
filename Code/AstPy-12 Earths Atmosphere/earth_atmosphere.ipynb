The Tropopause is the boundary between the Troposhere and the Stratosphere and so on. $h$ is the geopotential altitude above mean sea level (MSL) and $z$ is the geometric altidude above MSL. $h$ can be thought of as a gravity adjusted altitude. Since the value of the gravitational acceleration $g$ is not constant over the surface of the Earth or as you increase your altitude we use the adjusted height to define the boundaries between layers. Think of it this way, the altitude $z$ at which the Tropopause is found changes based on your position on the Earth because $g$ is not constant. By converting to $h$ the Tropopause is at the same altitude at every point on the Earth. You can convert from one to the other by using the following equations:\n",
