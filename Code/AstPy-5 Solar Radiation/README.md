### AIM - Visualise the blackbody radiation from different temperature suns and calculate the effective temperature of planets.

**Predict**

Have a think about these questions and make some predictions! Be sure to tell someone else what you predict.

1) Do hotter objects emit more longer or shorter wavelengths?    
2) What colour light does our sun emit the most of?
