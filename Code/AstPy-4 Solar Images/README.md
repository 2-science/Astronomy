# Stellar Fusion

Intro to Nuclear Fusion in stars.

**fusionLOG.py** creates the log scale version of the binding energy plot shown below:

**fusion.py** creates the same plot with linear scales.

**mass16.csv** was pre-processed from data by the Atomic Mass Data Center ([AMDC](http://amdc.impcas.ac.cn/filel.html)).
**mass16Abundant.csv** is the same but with only the most abundant isotope of each element.

The three pdfs contain further reading/are references that I used and link in the code and notebook.
