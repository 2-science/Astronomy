# Winter 2020/2021 Challenge - Tides

Earth has one Moon, Mars two, and Tatooine three! If Mars and Tatooine had oceans of water on them what would the tides be like?

Start by simulating the tides of the Earth - Moon system then move onto Mars!
If you want to stretch to three moons/Tatooine then you will have to make up values for distances etc of the moons.
