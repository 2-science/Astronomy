# Astronomy

**Astronomy Resources and Code** BETA  

**NEW DOCS** - [astropython.com](https://www.astropython.com)
Slowly updating the new docs! - The most complete info about each individual activity will likely remain in the individual activity README's.

YouTube Channel:

My channel [astroDimitrios](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf8Sg-cgLNubyCM5Em8eDZg/featured) has videos of some activities and challenges as well as beginner intro videos:

This repo is for my Astronomy PPTS, Code, and Practicals (including observing and astronomy club resources).  
I suggest you start by looking at the documents in the **CourseDocs** Directory.  
Those documents provide an overview of how to use these resources.

It was designed to be useful for any course however I use it to teach the BTEC National Extended Diploma in Applied Science Unit 16: Astronomy and Space.

## Test the Code

<p><strong>NEW: </strong>You can now test some of the activities on our JupyterHub. Sign up <a href="https://hub.astropython.com/hub/signup">here</a> with a username and password then head over to <a href="https://hub.astropython.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FastroDimitrios%2FLaunch&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FLaunch%2FWelcome.ipynb&branch=main">hub.astropython.com</a> and log in! (It's important to use the second link after signing up so you get sent to the Welcome document)

The welcome document has links which pull the activities you want to try from my GitHub. If something doesn't work please let me know! The server is built for my students so it can only handle 20-30 people at a time. If you do test out some of the activities let me know what you think.</p>

**NOTE:** The server may go down periodically. If you want to keep your work please download it to your local computer, do NOT assume it is safe forever on the hub. 

If you want to contribute or support the creation and upkeep of these resources please contact me at **astrodimitrios(at)gmail.com**
