My channel [astroDimitrios](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf8Sg-cgLNubyCM5Em8eDZg/featured) has videos of some activities and challenges as well as beginner intro videos:

This repo is for my Astronomy PPTS, Code, and Practicals (including observing and astronomy club resources).  
I suggest you start by looking at the documents in the **CourseDocs** Directory.  
Those documents provide an overview of how to use these resources.

It was designed to be useful for any course however I use it to teach the BTEC National Extended Diploma in Applied Science Unit 16: Astronomy and Space.

If you want to contribute or support the creation and upkeep of these resources please contact me at **astrodimitrios(at)gmail.com**
