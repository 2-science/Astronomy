The ***Observation Log.pdf*** is a booklet for students to record their observations in. There is also a partially filled in exemplar version.

A simpler version of this observation log is in the ***Astronomy Club*** directory which also includes a booklet of activities which students complete to earn stars. When students have enough stars they get a sticker for that page and eight stickers gets them their Awesome Amateur Astronomer badge. This document was based off the Awesome Astronomer pages of [https://www.unawe.org/](https://www.unawe.org/).
