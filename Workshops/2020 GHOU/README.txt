Hello and thanks for participating in my Astronomy and Python workshop at GHOU!
This folder contains the code that you can work on in your groups.

If you are unfamiliar with Python I suggest you download the code in
the Intro to Python folder.
Otherwise I have included one of our activities on Earth's Heat for you to try.

Download the files and head over to https://jupyter.org/try
Click on JupyterLab (middle top)
Once the lab is loaded you can navigate to the top left and upload the files you downloaded.
(Using the up arrow under the word Kernel)
It might be easier to make a new folder called GHOU to put the files in first!

Double click on the ipynb file and off you go!
Shift+Enter will run a code block.

If you have questions or trouble downloading the code email me:
astrodimitrios@gmail.com

All the best, 
Dimitrios

PS. Answers for the Heat activity can be found here on GitHub:
