Hello and thanks for participating in my Teaching Astronomy with Python workshop at the ASP2020 conf!
This folder contains the code that you can work on in your groups.

If you are unfamiliar with Python I suggest you download the code for the AstPy-1 Intro
activity.

Otherwise I have included AstPy-8 Planets which is the second activity I used with my students
and AstPy-10 which is more difficult than AstPy-8.

Download the files and head over to https://jupyter.org/try
Click on JupyterLab (middle top)
Once the lab is loaded you can navigate to the top left and upload the files you downloaded.
(Using the up arrow under the word Kernel)
It might be easier to make a new folder called ASP2020 to put the files in first!

Double click on the ipynb file and off you go!
Shift+Enter will run a code block.
(there is a Teacher.ipynb in AstPy-8 and AstPy-10 with the answers)

If you have questions or trouble downloading the code email me:
astrodimitrios@gmail.com

All the best, 
Dimitrios
